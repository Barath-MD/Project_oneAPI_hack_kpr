# **AI-Powered IoT-Based Intelligent System for the Early Detection of Foot Ulcers in Diabetic Patients**

* This project is focused mainly for diabetes patients who use shoes regularly for dtercting foot ulcer earlier. For diabetess patint the foot ulcar can cause severe porblems and will lead to amputation at final stage.
* We used a combination od Gen AI and IOT to produce a solution to detect the foot ulcer earlier to take precautions.
* A combination of sensors will be incooperated with the patient's shoes which will collect the data from the foot (ie Pressure, Temperature and Humidity)
* Based on the data the output will be generated by our AI model and it will ask the user for other questions to improve the model for the user specifications
* The final decision will be given by the AI model to the user

## Folders

+ The application folder contains the application file for the app to be downloaded by the user.

+ The IOT_code folder contains the code for the sensor data collection in the users shoes.

+ The jupyter_notebooks folder contains the AI model and datasets.
