# **AI-Powered IoT-Based Intelligent System for the Early Detection of Foot Ulcers in Diabetic Patients**
## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
> * Diabetes Patients are prone to foot infection due to lack of proper bloodflow , delayed recovery rate leading to Foot ulcer(unrecovered wound) leading to amputation of led fingers in worst care scenarios.
> * This project is focused on providing _**predctive alert and primary care measures**_ for patients who use _**shoes regularly**_ for detecting foot ulcer earlier. 
> * We used a combination of _**Gen AI**_(to provide primary care measures) and _**IOT**_(to acquire data from user) to produce a solution to detect the foot ulcer earlier to take precautions along with some care measures from Generative AI via _**pipeline**_ call.
> * A combination of sensors will be incorperated with the patient's shoes which will collect the data from the foot (ie Pressure(more than one points), Temperature and Humidity[to detect sweating])
> * Based on the data ,the output **(SNN Model - Binary result**) will be generated by our AI model and it will ask the user for other questions _**1)fixed questions are asked**_  and **2)direct text feedback** from user to improve the model for the user specifications
> * The final _**primary care measures**_ will be given by the AI model to the user .

## Folders

+ The **application** folder contains the application file for the app to be downloaded by the user.

+ The **IOT_code** folder contains the code for esp32 development board for the sensor data collection in the users shoes.

+ The **jupyter_notebooks** folder contains the jupyter notebook code for AI model and code for synthetic datasets.
